* Built when I initially learned modals, this project is primarily CSS-focused.
  * Only built for my browswer- is not mobile friendly
  
* Lessons learned:
  * When modal is active, blur in background should cover navigation bar as well
    * This assists when event listener is waiting for a click outside of the modal window itself, or, I could have just added an event listener on the navbar while modal was open
  * Flexbox has its advantages, but in a case like this where there is a specific layout it may be easier to use grid
